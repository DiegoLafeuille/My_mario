# Ideas and To-Do list

## Important
- Adjust collision rectangles size
    -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28805271/pygame-rect-collision-smaller-than-image
    - Player (sword should be able to clip)
    - Crates
    - Palm trees
- Correct the occasional clipping through terrain
- Jump on key-down
- Variable jump height
- When finished with everything -> remove possibility to win level by pressing return key

## Would be nice
- Collision with palm trees only when jumping on top of them
- HP counter + bar
- Drown animation
- Breakable crates
- Double jump (?)
